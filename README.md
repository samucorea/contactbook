# Contact Book project.

This project consists of a simple contact book. It requires the contact name, number and address. It was made with pure html, css and javascript.
It also has data persistence, using localStorage API.

## Things i learnt

This project made me understand localStorage at a deeper level. There's plenty of things that you can do with the localStorage API of javascript.
It is very easy to use, and provides you a way to save data on the browser. I also liked the way I organized the code. From my point of view, it's
clean. It has all the functions on one file, and the event binders and element queries on the other one. 

I also learnt how to make an overlay in the UI to show some dialog box for input information. It's very useful to know, since most sites use this
UI technique.
